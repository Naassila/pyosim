# Pyosim

> Pyosim is a python library building on top of [pyomeca](https://github.com/pyomeca/pyomeca) allowing you to batch process multiple musculoskeletal analysis performed by the OpenSim software.

## Pyosim documentation

See pyomeca's [documentation site]() (under construction and not usable yet), as well as pyomeca's [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/pyomeca/tutorials).

## Example

You can find some examples in the [`examples`](https://github.com/pyomeca/pyosim/tree/master/examples) folder.

## Installation

### Using Conda

First, install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
Then type:

```bash
conda install pyosim -c pyomeca
```

## Integration with other modules

Pyosim is designed to work well with other libraries that we have developed:

- [pyomeca](https://github.com/pyomeca/pyomeca): Python toolbox for biomechanics analysis
- [ezc3d](https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d): Easy to use C3D reader/writer in C++, Python and Matlab
- [biorbd](https://github.com/pyomeca/biorbd): C++ interface and add-ons to the Rigid Body Dynamics Library, with Python and Matlab binders.
- [pyoviz](https://github.com/pyomeca/pyoviz): pyomeca visualization toolkit and GUIs (still in development and not usable yet)
